### Hello, I'm Jonathan 👋

## About Me
I'm a backend software engineer with a passion for working on complex technologies, currently focused on the Ethereum stack and programmatic trading. I'm based out of the UK (note: this changes a lot but is accurate as of time of writing), I'm fluent in Spanish and am learning Russian, and outside of tech I'm a competitive chess player and play both the guitar and piano.

### 💼 Previous Experience
